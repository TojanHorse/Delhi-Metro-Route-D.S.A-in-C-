# Project Title

This Metro Route Finder helps commuters and metro travelers find the shortest route between metro stations. It is designed for daily passengers, tourists, and city planners who need quick and efficient navigation through the metro network using Dijkstra’s Algorithm


## Acknowledgements

 We would like to express our gratitude to:

Open-source contributors for providing valuable resources and documentation on graph algorithms.
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and other metro authorities for publicly available route maps and station details.
Data structure and algorithm communities for insights into implementing efficient pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
Developers and testers who helped refine and optimize the system for better usability.

## Installation

This project is a CLI-based Metro Route Finder that requires a simple C IDE like Code::Blocks or any C compiler. Since it is not a GUI application, it is lightweight, fast, and runs directly in the terminal without additional dependencies.

To install and run the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone the repository (if using Git)
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/metro-route-finder.git

# Open the project in Code::Blocks or any C compiler

# Compile and run the code
gcc metro_route_finder.c -o metro_finder
./metro_finder
Why CLI Over GUI?
Faster Execution: CLI applications run directly in the terminal without the overhead of graphical rendering.
Lightweight: No additional libraries or frameworks are needed, making it easy to install and run.
Better Debugging: Easier to test, debug, and modify without dealing with UI elements.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on any OS with a C compiler, unlike GUI apps which may require specific frameworks.
